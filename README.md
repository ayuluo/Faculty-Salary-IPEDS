# Faculty Salary from 1980 to 2001-IPEDS/IES
 The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) collects data annually on all post-secondary institutions eligible for Title IV aid (federal student loans and grants). Among the many survey components is one on salaries for instructional staff. This Stata do.file is to create a dataset of salaries for full-time instructional staff for 1980, 1990, and 2001. The file contains variables for total salary outlays, number of staff, and average salary, and is long by year, unitid (the institutional identifier), academic rank, contract length, and sex. The raw files contain different variables and are in a different format each year; the goal is to harmonize these into a consistent panel dataset that is easy for others to use.
